# Surface pending registry alerts so an agent can relay them in chat. The
# receiver writes every alert (trigger fired, order placed, error, warning)
# to the SQLite registry; this script prints any unacked alerts as plain
# text. This is the in-chat counterpart to Telegram and works whether
# Telegram is configured or not.
#
# Agents should run this on every session start (AGENTS.md instructs this)
# or whenever the user asks about strategy status. Wire it into your
# agent's session-start / pre-prompt hook if your CLI supports it.
#
# Behavior:
# - exits 0 silently if there's nothing to report (no alerts, no DB yet,
#     missing env, registry_cli not importable)
# - never blocks the user prompt (stderr swallowed, errors non-fatal)
# - prints the ack command after alerts so the agent can clear them explicitly
