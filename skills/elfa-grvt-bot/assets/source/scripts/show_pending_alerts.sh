# Surface pending registry alerts to the Claude session as injected
# UserPromptSubmit context. The receiver writes every alert (trigger fired,
# order placed, error, warning) to the SQLite registry; this script prints
# any unacked alerts so Claude can relay them in chat in real time. This is
# the in-chat counterpart to Telegram, and works whether Telegram is
# configured or not.
#
# Wired into .claude/settings.json as a UserPromptSubmit hook.
#
# Behavior:
#   - exits 0 silently if there's nothing to report (no alerts, no DB yet,
#     missing env, registry_cli not importable)
#   - never blocks the user prompt (stderr swallowed, errors non-fatal)
#   - auto-acks alerts after printing so the same item isn't repeated
