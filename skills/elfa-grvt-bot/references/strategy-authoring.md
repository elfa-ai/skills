# Strategy authoring flow

How an agent turns a user's natural-language strategy description into an active Auto query plus a registered local strategy.

This file documents the chat flow. The same instructions ship as `assets/source/AGENTS.template.md`, which `bootstrap.py` copies to `AGENTS.md` in the user's project root. Any agent that supports the AGENTS.md convention (most do) will pick it up on session start in that directory.

## On every session start in the project

Before responding to anything else, run:

```bash
python -m pip show elfa-grvt-bot >/dev/null 2>&1 || pip install -e ".[dev]" --quiet
python src/registry_cli.py alerts --pending
```

If there are unacknowledged alerts, surface them at the top of the response in this format:

> N unacknowledged alert(s):
> - **#<id>** [category] <message> (strategy=<query_id>)
>
> Say `ack <id>` to clear, or `ack all` to clear all.

If the user says `ack <id>` or `ack all`, run `python src/registry_cli.py ack <id-or-all>`.

If there are no pending alerts, say nothing about alerts and continue.

## When the user describes a strategy

1. **Forward the description to Elfa Builder Chat** (`POST /v2/auto/chat`) with the user's natural-language prompt. API-key auth (`x-elfa-api-key` header).

   Before calling Builder Chat, prepend `Notify me when:` to the user's description unless the description is already framed as a notification request (e.g. it already starts with "notify me", "alert me", "tell me when", etc.). This is non-negotiable: the Elfa-side action must be `notify` (or another notify-style action), never an execute / trade action. Do not double-wrap if the user's description is already framed that way.

   The response shape per `docs.elfa.ai/api/rest/auto-chat-v-2` is:

   ```json
   {
     "sessionId": "session-uuid",
     "response": "I can help with that...\n\n```json\n{...EQL draft...}\n```\n",
     "title": "BTC Breakout Alert",
     "reasoning": null,
     "planIds": []
   }
   ```

   The EQL draft is embedded as a fenced JSON code block inside the `response` markdown. **Extract that JSON verbatim** and use it as the `query` field when calling validate / create. `sessionId` lets you continue the conversation on follow-up prompts; persist it if you want to iterate with Builder Chat on the same draft.

   **Never hand-write or hand-edit the EQL `conditions` block.** Builder Chat is the only authority. If its conditions don't match the user's intent (wrong operator, missing leg of an AND, wrong timeframe, etc.), re-prompt Builder Chat with a clearer description (or use `sessionId` to continue the same conversation) or ask the user to rephrase; do not edit the JSON yourself. `references/elfa-eql.md` documents the syntax for understanding what Builder Chat returned, not as a spec for you to write against.

2. **Ask the user for any GRVT order params they did not volunteer**:
 - Symbol on GRVT (e.g. `SOL_USDT_Perp`). Before continuing, verify the symbol exists by calling `GrvtCcxt.fetch_market(symbol)` from the grvt-trading skill. If it raises or returns nothing, tell the user "GRVT doesn't have that token" and stop. There is no static allowlist; GRVT itself is the source of truth.
 - Size in base-asset units (or notional in USD if the user prefers; convert)
 - Order type (market or limit; default market)
 - Limit price if limit order
 - Leverage (optional; usually account-default applies anyway)
 - Time-in-force (optional; default `GOOD_TILL_TIME`)
 - `max_notional_usd` cap (default a small buffer over expected notional)
 - `tp_pct` and `sl_pct` (optional; if either provided, the receiver arms an OTOCO bracket)

3. **Validate the EQL** via `POST /v2/auto/queries/validate`. Per `docs.elfa.ai/api/rest/auto-validate-query-v-2` the response is `{valid, errors, warnings, estimatedCost, simulationLlmCallsEstimate}`. If `valid` is `false`, surface the errors and stop. Don't call create. Validate is free; create is not.

4. **Show the user the full plan**:
 - The EQL conditions
 - The order spec (side, size, symbol, type, leverage)
 - Cap, env, expiry
 - Estimated credits / cost from validate's `estimatedCost`
 - For LLM strategies: the simulation LLM call estimate

   Wait for an explicit "yes". (If the user wants to know whether the condition is already true, call `POST /v2/auto/queries/validate` first or poll-query after create to read `latestEvaluation.wouldTriggerNow` - that field lives on the poll response, not the validate response.)

5. **On approval**:
   a. `POST /v2/auto/queries` with the validated body unchanged. Default `expiresIn` is `24h` unless the user requested otherwise. The response shape is `{queryId, status, cost}` per `docs.elfa.ai/api/rest/auto-create-query-v-2`.
   b. `python src/registry_cli.py add ...` with all the strategy params, using the `queryId` returned by create. The CLI stores it as the local `query_id` column.
   c. Confirm to the user with the `queryId`, status (`active`), and expiry.
   d. The receiver's supervisor polls the registry every ~5s and will open an SSE stream for the new query automatically. If the receiver is not running, the user needs to start it (`python -m elfa_grvt_bot`).

## Defaults this project uses

| Param | Default |
|---|---|
| `expiresIn` | `24h` |
| Order type | `market` |
| Time-in-force | `GOOD_TILL_TIME` |
| `tp_pct` / `sl_pct` | None (no OTOCO bracket) unless user provides |
| Max notional cap | (no default; ALWAYS ask user explicitly) |
| Actions | passthrough - whatever Builder Chat returns; not read by the bot |

## Operator selection

Default to the operator that best matches the user's intent. Common cases:

- "RSI dips below 30" -> `crosses_below 30` (transition; fires on the cross)
- "RSI is below 30" -> `<` (state; fires whenever true at eval)
- "Price breaks above 100k" -> `crosses_above 100000`
- "Price greater than X" or "X+" -> `>`
- "When @account posts about Y" -> `llm.athena_condition` (==, value=true)

When ambiguous, ask. If the current value is already on the trigger side (e.g. price already > X), surface that explicitly so the user knows the strategy will fire immediately on creation if they pick the state operator.

## Position stacking

By default, strategies stack: if a strategy fires while the user has an existing open position on the same symbol, the receiver places another entry plus its own TP/SL bracket. GRVT will net the positions; total reduce-only across both brackets must remain at-or-below the position size (GRVT enforces with code 2402).

If the user wants wait-for-flat semantics ("don't fire if I already have a position"), this is not implemented in v1 but is a known follow-up. Offer it as a future enhancement.

## Strict rules

These are non-negotiable for this project:

- **No em-dashes** (U+2014) anywhere: chat, code, commits, alert text, API request bodies. Replace with hyphens, parens, colons, or commas. Project-wide convention for ASCII-only output.

- **Never author or hand-edit EQL.** Builder Chat is the only authority. If its output is wrong, re-prompt with a clearer description; do not patch the JSON. `references/elfa-eql.md` is a reference for understanding Builder Chat's output, not a spec to write against.

- **Don't manipulate Builder Chat's actions block.** Pass it through unchanged. The receiver consumes triggers via SSE on the query id, not via the actions block.

- **Elfa-side action must always be notify-style** (`notify`, `telegram_bot`, etc.). Always prepend `Notify me when:` to the user's description before calling Builder Chat. Never use `/v2/auto/exchanges` or any exchange-execution action type. Order placement happens in our receiver via `grvt-pysdk`, full stop. Auto's role is conditions plus notification only.

- **`GRVT_ENV` is locked to `prod`** for this project. The receiver's `Config` rejects any other value at boot. Do NOT add `I_UNDERSTAND_REAL_MONEY=yes` or any equivalent gate. The safety layer is the explicit per-strategy "yes" in chat.

- **Always poll GRVT for live position state**, never rely on session memory. Before reporting a position, balance, or open order, run `c.fetch_positions(...)`, `c.fetch_balance()`, `c.fetch_open_orders(...)`. Local registry holds strategy metadata only; that is fine to read locally.

## Cancelling a strategy

If the user asks to cancel a strategy by `query_id`:

```bash
python src/registry_cli.py cancel <query_id>
```

This calls Elfa `POST /v2/auto/queries/:id/cancel` and updates the local registry status to `cancelled`. (Hard-deletion via `DELETE /v2/auto/queries/:id` is allowed only after cancel; the project intentionally does not delete so the strategy stays auditable.)

## Reading state

- Active strategies: `python src/registry_cli.py list --status active`
- All strategies: `python src/registry_cli.py list`
- Pending alerts: `python src/registry_cli.py alerts --pending`
- All alerts: `python src/registry_cli.py alerts`
- Live GRVT state: query GRVT directly via `pysdk.grvt_ccxt.GrvtCcxt`

## Things to NOT do

- Don't place orders directly via the grvt-trading skill from the chat session. The receiver owns order placement. Read-only operations (fetch_balance, fetch_market, fetch_ticker, fetch_positions) for sanity checks during authoring are fine.
- Don't commit secrets to the registry or any tracked file. `.env` is in `.gitignore`.
- Don't strip or replace Builder Chat's actions block. Pass it through unchanged. The receiver consumes SSE on the query id, not the actions block.
- Don't hand-write or hand-edit the `conditions` block ever. Builder Chat is the only authority for EQL. If its output is wrong, re-prompt with a clearer description; do not patch the JSON yourself.
- Don't ask Elfa to execute trades. The Elfa-side action must always be notify-style. Order placement is owned by our receiver.
- Don't skip validation. Always `validate_query` before `create_query`.
